Module User

V4.6 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: module_user | user-admin -> the dashboard is pre-selected as the start-module for new users


V4.5 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: module_user -> if a user is deleted, the entry in the user-table remains, but is flagged as deleted (logical deletion). Nevertheless, the assigned subsystem is triggered for a real deletion. This avoids "n.a." entries in logfiles and other historical entries. The username itself is appended by "user no longer available" to indicate, that the user was deleted. Using regular methods, deleted users are no longer available or loadable. [ART #1009]

V4.4 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: refactored and streamlined some parts of the blocked-group handling. now integrated into more scenarios of the user management, reduced duplicated code fragments
NEW: the default-module loaded on login is configurable per user #845
NEW: when browsing members of a group, users may be added directly #868
NEW: deleting a user/group triggers a log-entry leveled as "warning", including more details about the object to be deleted
NEW: the user-formentry accepts active-users / groups only
NEW: added hint to user form (user needs group assignment) #849
BUG: some icons from the user-list are hidden in case the user is inactive, e.g. the userswitch or the send new password action
BUG: if a user edits its own profile (selfedit mode), the username is reset internally to avoid changes by dom-manipulations


V4.3 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: added a remove-icon to the user-selector in order to remove a selected user from the form-field
NEW: changed the icon for "send new password to user" from icon_mail to icon_mailNew
NEW: added a possibility to define a list of blocked groups, for those groups user-assignments are only allowed for members of the super-admin group. may be used in special scenarios to avoid privilege escalations
BUG: the packagemanager / user list filter could trigger reloads to each other instead of reloading the matching list
