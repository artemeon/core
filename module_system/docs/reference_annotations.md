Reference: Annotations
===
Kajona uses annotations in various places. Annotations are used to create an OR-mapping (object to database) or to setup the edit-form for a given object.
Below is a reference of annotations currently available.

Annotation         |Context    |Introduced in     |Description
-------------------|-----------|------------------|--------------------
|@addSearchIndex	|Property	|4.4	|Marks a property as relevant for being index. As soon as the search-index of an object is updated, all properties marked with this annotation will be added to the index.
|@autoTestable	|Method	|4.0	|Methods marked with this annoations are called in a unit-test during builds.

|@blockFromAutosave	|Class	|4.6	|If a class is marked with this annotation, the generalModel unit-tests skips this class. This means, the test won't try to save and delete the object automatically. May be useful if the marked class only works in combination with other classes or hierarchy elements.
|@elementContentTtitle	|Property	|4.3|	Allowed for element-admin-classes. The value of the property marked with this annotation is used as a list-title, so when rendering the list of page-elements in the backend.
|@fieldDDValues key -> value	|Property	|4.3|	Only to be used in combination with @fieldType dropdown, lists the key-value-pairs of options. Syntax: [ index => langKey ],[ index => langKey]. Example: @fieldDDValues [0 => commons_no],[1 => commons_yes]
|@fieldHidden	|Property	|4.3	|Flag to move a form-entry to the list of hidden form-fields. Hidden in terms of not visible by default, may be shown using a css / js call.
|@fieldTemplateDir path	|Property	|4.3	|Only to be used in combination with @fieldType template (template formentry). Defines the path to the directory of templates to choose from.
|@fieldType type	|Property	|4.0	|Sets the formentry-renderer to be used for the property when rendering the edit-form of the current object.
|@fieldMandatory	|Property	|4.0	|Marks the property as mandatory when editing the object via the form-generator.
|@fieldLabel label	|Property	|4.0	|If given, the passed lang-key is used to label the property on object-edits using the form-generator.
|@fieldValidator validator	|Property	|4.0 |Sets the formentry-validator to be used for the property when validating the edit-form of the current object.
|@fieldHidden	|Property	|4.4	|Moves the property to the list of hidden/optinal form-elements. Hidden form-elements are not visisible by default but may be shown using a link.
|@fieldReadonly	|Property	|4.4	|Marks the property as a read-only formentry (same as setBitReadOnly(true))
|@listOrder ASC\\|DESC	|Property	|4.2	|The property is used as a sort-criteria when loading object-lists dynamically.
|@module name	|Class	|4.3	|The name of the module the current class belongs to, e.g. "news".

|@objectList[Name] class	|Class	|4.2|	Assigns an object type (class) to an action-name (actionList), see evensimpler-classes. Used to render a list.
|@objectEdit[Name] class	|Class	|4.2	|Assigns an object type (class) to an action-name (actionEdit), see evensimpler-classes. Used to render an edit-form.
|@objectNew[Name] class	|Class	|4.2	|Assigns an object type (class) to an action-name (actionNew), see evensimpler-classes. Used to render a new-instance form.

|@tableColumn table.column	|Property	|4.0	|Sets the target-column of a property, used by the OR-mapper on loading / persisting the object.
|@tableColumnDatatype type	|Property	|4.6|	Relevant when generating the CREATE TABLE ddl, sets the columns target type. See [https://github.com/kajona/kajonacms/blob/master/module_system/system/class\_db\_datatypes.php](https://github.com/kajona/kajonacms/blob/master/module_system/system/class_db_datatypes.php) for a reference of values.
|@tableColumnIndex	|Property	|4.6|	An index is created on table-level for the given property (and so the mapped column).
|@tableColumnPrimaryKey	|Property	|4.6	|If given at a property, the ddl generated by the system will use the property as a primary key of the table.
