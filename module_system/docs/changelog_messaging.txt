Module Messaging

V4.7.2 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUG: module_messaging | admi view -> fixed a possible xss vulnerability when rendering a configs-value on change (fixes curesec vulnerability report)

V4.6 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: module_messaging | messages-> migrated column message_body from text to longtext
BUG: module_messaging | messaging -> rendering of a message without a linked message-provider crashed the message-list view
BUG: module_messaging | admin view -> the status-batch action handlers (set active, set inactive) where shown for the list of messages

V4.5 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: module_messaging | messageprovider -> extended the interface_messageprovider_extended by a method isVisibleInConfigView. Allows provides to decide if the provider is visible on on the config pane or hidden.
NEW: module_messaging | admin view -> if a message no longer existing is opened (e.g. out of an old mail), a error-dialog instead of an exception is shown

V4.4 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: integrated local Notifications into messaging #824
NEW: messages created as a reply contain the original message-body as a reference #861
NEW: personal messages can't be disabled locally
NEW: refactored the messaging api. It is now possible to save the senders' user-id #843.
NEW: added direct reply action to messages
NEW: refactored and relayouted the view-message view
NEW: message-notifications sent by the messaging use the senders-mail address if available
NEW: the messaging config-page uses a data-table to config the message-sources, way better overview
NEW: added support for non-deactivatable message-provideres. a new interface interface_messageprovider_extended controls 1. whether the provider may de disabled in general and 2. whether the providers' email-notification may be disabled.  This change is backwards compatible since the new interface extends the existing one. #831
NEW: removed the method getIdentifier from interface_messageprovider, the provider is now referenced by its classname.
NEW: added a workflow sending a summary of unread messages to users. The interval in days is configurable as well as the time the summary is sent. The summary is created by a workflow, so a running worflow-engine is required. The summary itself is sent using the messaging subsystem, so each user may dis-/enable the summary on its own. #828


V4.3 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: the admin-action "mailForm" sends messages rather using the messaging subsystem instead of sending direct mails
NEW: added a subject to messages. if given used as the displayname, otherwise the first part of the body is used. #811
NEW: the messaging details view uses replaceTextLinks() to make textual links cklickable #812
BUG: added some more type-safety for postgres-databases
BUG: if the session expired on the server but the client still tries to fetch the list of unread messages, an exception was thrown. since this is a rather common scenario, the logs could have been flooded with unuseful messages.
BUG: when viewing a message, some line-breaks in text-links resulted in broken link-targets
