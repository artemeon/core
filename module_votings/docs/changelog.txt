Module Votings

V1.6 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUG: module_votings | portal -> when rendering a voting on the portal, all answers including those of other votings were loaded instead of only the assigned answers.

V1.5 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: tag-favorites may be created / removed inline via an ajax call. #859
NEW: tagging a record only requires view-permissions, no longer edit permissions since tags are only declarative additions.
BUG: the tags-autocomplete reacts on enter-key-press as expected, adding the suggested entry to the end of the list of tags instead of replacing them
BUG: deleting a tag-assignment could fail on sqlite
BUG: fixed a sql-error on postgres/oracle
BUG: tags found by the search are linked to the list of assigned records instead of the tags edit-view
BUG: the tag-overlay missed to set the correct focus #858
BUG: copying a record with an assigned tag could failed due to an erroneous query

V1.3 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: added a config-entry for private tag assignments by default (yes / no)
BUG: fixed the right1 permission handling (save tag as favorite)
BUG: fixed the path navigation in module tags
