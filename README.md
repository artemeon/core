> This is a fork of the open source CMS Kajona. The project was forked to decouple the backend framework in order to transform it into a web application framework.

Kajona Core Framework
==========

Welcome to the sources of Kajona, an open source content management system.

Please refer to our website at http://www.kajona.de for further details and prepared builds ready for use.

Build-System
---
We currently provide various build-scripts in order to test, clean, build and package a project out of the sources.
Please have a look at the ant-scripts located at ```_buildfiles```: ```build_jenkins.xml```, ```build_project.xml```


Quickstart
---

You only have to follow a few steps in order to build a Kajona project out of the sources:

* Create a folder in your webroot, used to store the later Kajona project, e.g. ```kajona```
* Create a folder named ```core``` within the folder created before, e.g. ```kajona/core```
* Clone the Git-repo inside the core-folder: Change to the new directory and use the following command:
```git clone https://github.com/kajona/kajonacms.git .```
* The folder ```kajona/core``` should now be filled with a structure similar to: 
```
    /_debugging
    /module_system
    /module_samplecontent
    /module_system
    /module_tags
    .htaccess
    bootstrap.php
    setupproject.php
```
* Open the file ```kajona/core/setupproject.php``` using the webbrowser of your choice (btw, you could run this script on the command line, too)
* After a few log-outputs, your ```kajona``` folder is now setup like a real Kajona project, so there should be a structure similar to
```
    /core (as created manually)
    /files
    /project
    /templates
    .htaccess
    debug.php
    image.php
    index.php
    installer.php
    xml.php
```

> Have a look at the end of the results: If you see some red lines (composer messages) the setupproject could NOT run the composer commands successfully! Please run the commands manually from the command line or a terminal window.

Done! All you have to do is to fire up your browser, opening the file ```kajona/installer.php``` and the installer will guide you through the process.
Whenever you make changes to s.th. below /core, don't forget to create a pull-request with all those changes - and be sure to earn the glory!
