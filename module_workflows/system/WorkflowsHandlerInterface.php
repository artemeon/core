/**
 * A single workflow has to implement this interface.
 *
 * A handler should be capable to fulfill the following semantic contract:
 *
 * - handler is created and attached to a new workflow -> nothing to do
 *   handler is marked as NEW
 *
 * - transition from new to scheduled:
 *     - initialize() is called, the handler can update it's data (and the data of the workflow)
 *     - schedule() is called, the handler can set the next date the workflow should be triggered
 *   handler is marked as SCHEDULED
 *
 * - execution of workflow and handler, run the handlers main logic
 *   execute is called. depending on the return value, the following scenarios are possible:
 *     - true: handler is marked as EXECUTED and
 *     - false:
 *          - schedule() is called
 *          - handler remains marked as SCHEDULED
 *          - number of executions is increased
 *
 * Please note:
 *   Do NOT call updateObjectToDb on the workflow-instance.
 *   This call is done at the end of every transition. Otherwise the data saved in the objects may get
 *   invalid!
